## Description

This is a simple HTML + JS application turning the computer keyboard into a drum kit. Selected keyboard keys are assigned with audio files which are played upon key press. The pressed keys are also displayed on the screen. Creating this application allowed me to:

<li>Practice writing JS code, namely event listeners, query selectors and functions.</li>
<li>Practice searching for solutions to specific problems online and adjust procured answers and code snippets to my own needs.</li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow </li><br>

## Usage
